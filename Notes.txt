Terminal:
    ls = print all items in current directory
    cd = moves directory
    pwd = prints current directory
    mkdir = makes new directory at current locaiton with provided name
    touch = creates empty file in current directory with given file name


Git:
    git add = adds named files to the staging area, ready to be committed
        git add . = adds all files in current directory to staging area
    git commit -m "message" = commits added files with given description
    git push = pushes all commited files to github, "saving" them online
    git status = reports current status of directory (changes, new files, etc)
    git clone (url) = copies github repo onto computer into current directory
    git diff = shows specific changes in files

Shortcuts:
    Ctrl+Shift+M = checks code for style mistakes

Code:
    try:
        code
    except __error_name__: = tries to run the first block of code, and if it encounters the named error, runs the second block of code
        code

Notation:
    """
    Docstring = Long annotation, basically
    """
    #Comment = put a hashtag before code to make it a comment that doesn't run
    -> Optional[type] = Adds the option of the function returning either the provided types or none

Function notation example:
    """
    Description of what the function does (ex: gets user's age)

    Parameters
    =========
    What arguments the function calls, and what they represent
        ex: string
            supplied age as string


    Returns
    =======
    What the function returns, and what it represents
        ex: int
            supplied age as int

    Raises:
    =======
    What errors the function could result in, and how that error could be raised
        ex: Value Error
            The supplied age was not an integer
    """


Testing:
    unittest = Important library for testing functions
    from unittest.mock import patch, Mock = Code to import patch and mock functionality from unittest
    @patch('builtins.input', side_effect=[__input__]) = hijacks the input function for testing, using provided value as the input
    def test_functionname_scenario(self, _: Mock) -> None= definition for a test that includes mock
    self.assertTrue(function_name(args)) = Asserts that the called function will return true
    self.assertFalse(function_name(args)) = Asserts that the called function will return false
    self.assertEqual(function_name(args), __value__) = Asserts that the called function will return a specific value
    with self.assertRaises(__error_type__): = Asserst that the called function will result in the named error
        function_name(args)
    def test_functionname_scenario(self) -> None = Definitions for a test that does not include mock
    if __name__=="__main__": = Just put it in the testing file idk lol
        unittest.main()

Test function notation example:
    def test_functionname_scenario(self) -> Name:
    """Tests the function for the given scenario"""
    self.assertTrue(function_name(args))
